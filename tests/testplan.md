### **Objectives**
*Verify Functional Requirements*
1. Ensure core features such as user authentication, waste management scheduling, admin operations, and content interaction behave as expected.
2. Confirm data persistence to ensure it meets consistency and integrity requirements.
3. Validate input handling through form validation.

*Non-Functional Attributes*
1. Measure and optimize performance, including page load speed and interface responsiveness.
2. Evaluate usability by checking for intuitive navigation and user-friendly design.
3. Confirm accessibility and screen reader compatibility.
4. Conduct security checks such as input sanitization and session protection.
5. Test cross-browser and device compatibility to ensure responsive design.

*Investigate Focus Areas*
1. Identify and analyze intentional flaws inserted for quality assurance practice.
2. Stress-test the system with edge cases and unexpected user input.
3. Assess user experience with attention to workflow logic and information architecture.
4. Ensure data integrity and reliability in local storage interactions.
